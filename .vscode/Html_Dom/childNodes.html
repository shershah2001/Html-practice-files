    <div id="myDIV">
        <p>First p element (index 1)</p>
        <p>Second p element (index 3)</p>

    <p>The number of child nodes in "myDIV" are:</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <p>Whitespace between elements are text nodes. In this example, index 0, 2 and 4 in "myDIV" are text nodes.</p>

        const body = document.body;
        console.log(body.childNodes[4])// childNodes  this gives you a nodelist of child element of div or body and you can also access that list like array, ex = > arr[0] you also extract element from Nodelist like this Nodelist[0] but it doesn't means that it is a array. you can't use array method on Nodelist like map, filter , find , reduce method. to use this method you have to convert this Nodelist first into array.
        const bodyNodes = body.childNodes;

            for (let i = 0; i < bodyNodes.length; i++) {

            }
        } // you can't use for on the childNodes list
